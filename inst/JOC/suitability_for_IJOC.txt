From the editorial statement:

> The theory and practice of computing and operations research are
> necessarily intertwined. The INFORMS Journal on Computing publishes
> high quality papers that expand the envelope of operations research
> and computing.

The submission presents novel software that fills a specific need for
relativistic velocity addition in the R language.

> We seek original research papers on relevant theories, methods,
> experiments, systems, and applications.  We also welcome novel
> survey and tutorial papers, and papers describing new and useful
> software tools.

The sofware associated with this submision is new and useful to a
range of practitioners working in the field.  It has been used to
search for a new distributive law of Einsteinian velocity addition.


> We expect contributions that can be built upon by subsequent
> researchers or used by practitioners.

The software has significant potential for further work including
preliminary computational work in general relativity.
